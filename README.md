# misfits-market-app

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/92cfec53-5f31-4fc0-9658-b8b328e0bac1/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/misfits-market-test/deploys)

Forked from my [react-boilerplate-app](<https://github.com/willbuckingham/react-boilerplate-app>) which is based on Create React App, to get started.

Added:

* Material UI (which I've been meaning to add to the boiler plate anyways, so I'll back port that later)
* There are a basic set of tests, though I would not consider them fully covered.

## Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test` and `npm test:coverage`

Launches the tests in watch mode or in coverage report mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run lint` & `npm run lint:fix`

Runs the code linting and applies fix respectively.
